neural_net.py (nn):
-use tensorflow to make a sound recognition neural network
-take a fourier transformed sound byte as input
-output is an size 88 column vector with each index corrseponding to a note
-note that (ba dum tss) multiple notes can be flagged as "played"
-running alone trains said neural net with the data in the traning_data/primed_data folder

sound_engine.py (se):
-listens to audio input from microphone
-idk what the sampling rate is - it's TBD
-runs an FFT on the sound bytes as input into the neural net
-running alone creates a csv file with fft arrays on its own line and the music note represented on the next line
from the files in training_data/raw_data folder

run_main.py:
-after training is complete, couples together the nn and the se to flow between the two as smoothly
as possible

unit_tests.py:
-tests outputs in se and (maybe) the nn against known data to see if it works
-useful for debugging basically

training_data folder:
-use finale printmusic to create sound bytes of many many MANY notes and chords
-note to use many different instruments to train neural network
-add in a few "real life" sound bytes as well from violin, flute, piano, and the instruments of friends
-only use 4/5 to train and 1/5 to test

things you need to learn:
-how to use tensorflow *properly* LOL
-how to handle audio input
