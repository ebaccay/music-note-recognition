# Music Note Neural Net (MN-cubed)

This project is more of a proof-of-concept for a potential app in the future. The inspiration for this project came from me playing the piano with my sheet music on an iPad. After being annoyed by turning the page every time I reach the end of a measure, I decided to take things into my own hands and create an application to do that for me.

After music note recognition at an acceptable level is reached, things such as chord recognition (stemming from creating chord data sets), sheet music recognition (using computer vision algorithms), and a cohesive front end web app (or even mobile app) are planned.
