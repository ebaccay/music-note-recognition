# Music Note Neural Net (MN-cubed)

This project is more of a proof-of-concept for a potential app in the future. This project was inspired by being annoyed at my iPad for not turning the damn page when playing music LOL. After a minimum viable product is reached, things such as chord recognition (stemming from chord data sets), sheet music recognition (using computer vision algorithms), and a cohesive front end web app (or even mobile app) are planned.
